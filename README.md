# Fish-Species-Identification-CNN

## Group Members: 
Alberto Alvarado, Jeff Neal, Dominic Thomas, Angelie Wanner

## Project Proposal:
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying different species of fish from images. The project will involve data collection, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to identify various fish species with high accuracy.

Further enhancements to this project can effectively be beneficial to researchers, conservationists, and fishing enthusiasts. By following a structured approach, we aim to build an effective and user-friendly classification system.

## Process:
We utilized a convolutional neural network model to test, train, and validate our image dataset. We also leveraged the following tools: Python, Flask, Web Based UI (HTML/Js), Tensorflow
